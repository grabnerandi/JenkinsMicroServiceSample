## Dynatrace Jenkins Tutorial

This tutorial is based of the following GitHub project: https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices
And here is the blog from Piotr that explains what the pre-requisits are and how this End-to-End Pipeline really works: https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/microservices-continuous-delivery-with-docker-and-jenkins/

I use this tutorial that pushes a Spring Microservice App through a Jenkins Pipeline to show how to integrate Dynatrace into the pipeline to demonstrate the following use cases:
* Shift-Right: Push Jenkins Deployment Information to Dynatrace
* Shift-Left: Pull Dynatrace Quality Information back to Jenkins Pipeline, e.g: Stop the Pipeline in case of Performance or any other quality issues

THIS IS STILL WORK in PROGRESS!!
