## Dynatrace Jenkins Tutorial

This tutorial is based of the following GitHub project: https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices
I use this tutorial that pushes a Spring Microservice App through a Jenkins Pipeline to show how to integrate Dynatrace into the pipeline to demonstrate the following use cases:
* Shift-Right: Push Jenkins Deployment Information to Dynatrace
* Shift-Left: Pull Dynatrace Quality Information back to Jenkins Pipeline, e.g: Stop the Pipeline in case of Performance or any other quality issues

THIS IS STILL WORK in PROGRESS!!
